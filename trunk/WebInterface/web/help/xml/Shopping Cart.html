									<p>Your shopping basket will show all your selected studies, data sets and data files and will keep the information until you explicitly delete it. You have the possibility to sort your entries either by name or by the date they have been added to the shopping cart.
</p>
<p>Generally you have the following options for all entries in your shopping cart:

</p>

<ul>
	<li>Delete the item</li>
	<li>Transfer an item</li>
	<li>Look up information about the study the dataset or file came from</li>
	<li>Add personal notes to a particular file (e.g. as to why you wanted it)</li>
<li>Manipulate the item (if available)</li>
<li>View the date that it was added</li>
	
</ul>
<p>You have the possibility to either delete only selected entries - click on the delete field behind the entry and then on the delete button beneath this column. Otherwise you can delete the complete content of the shopping basket by clicking on the delete all contents button at the bottom of the page. Currently items can only be downloaded one at a time using http. You only need to press the download button and an http transfer to your machine will be performed. For each selected item the initial query for study is preserved. If you press the goto button it will repeat this request and show you the up to date information about this study. You can then either explore this study again or return to your shopping basket.

</p>
<p>For each item in the shopping basket you have the possibility to add your personal comments e.g. what you have done to the selected file, why you have selected it or what you wanted to do next. If you click on the view button it will show you all existing comments you have recorded and also gives you the opportunity to add, change or delete them. Please note that these functionalities are only rudimentary and do not offer a fully fledge word processing service.

 

</p>
<p>On the page you will find a list of base parameters, which can be restricted (mainly date, place and here altitude). For each of them a valid value range is given to aid the selection process. In addition you can select specific countries at the bottom of the page to help with the selection of the correct latitude and longitude boundaries. Once you have set your boundary conditions you can then go on to the manipulation, currently you can select to calculate the minimum, maximum and average of the available parameters e.g. temperature. When you have selected and filled all the required fields press calculate and the result will appear at the bottom of the page.

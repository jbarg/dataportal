The module is now rewritten to allow NGS users log in with his/her own MyProxy
username/password without a local account.

This is the March 31, 2003 release of the CHEF COG module kit.

This is designed to operate with the 1_0_7 release of CHEF with the 
chef_1_0_7_modules_03_31_03_patch applied.

This can support either COG 0.9.13 or COG-1.0a. As distributed, it is setup 
for COG 0.1.13 as it is the most commonly used version of the COG.

This also supports Technology Preview 3 of OGSA.

If you want to use COG-1.0a, rename the cog directory to cog-0.9.13 and
rename the cog-1.0a directory  to cog.

As you switch back and forth, make sure to restore the tomcat common/lib directory
to tos contents before the first deployment of CHEF.  It is a good idea to make a
copy of common/lib before you do your first CHEF deployment.

In addition to this COG Kit, you must initialize the PKI security on your system.

We typically use a Microsoft Windows platform for development and Linux for production.

For Windows, the simplest way to do this is to install the COG kit and run the setup
process in the COG kit.  You will need a user certificate, key and a CA certificate from
the certificate authority.

For UNIX you need to get and install a host certificate.

About the only necessary configuration is in the file:

 umich/grid/conf/chef_site_resources.properties

Where you specify which myproxy server to use.  The default is myproxy.ncsa.uiuc.edu.

         [http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=376]

------------------------ 0.9.13 ----------------------------------------------

- (03/28)  Added two methods to Gram class to explicitely register or 
           unregister a job from a given callback handler. Before, only
           the internal callback handler were used for job status updates.

- (03/20)  Added support for data channel authentication (DCAU) for the FTP
           library. Integrated the new FTP code with url-copy library and
           tool. Added GridFTP stream classes.

- (02/21)  Updated MyProxy API and added support for the anonymous get 
           operation (where local credentials are not required)

- (02/20)  Check in new iaik libraries (to work with Java 1.4)

- (02/18)  Added gridmap file support.

- (02/17)  Changed default behaviour of how user cert, key, ca certificates 
           and proxy files are discovered. Now, a system property is first 
           checked, then configuration option (initialized from from a file 
           for example) and then the local file system is checked 
           appropriately.

- (02/16)  Added 'httpg' protocol handler for Java URL class. It can be
           seamlessly integrated with the standard Java URL class.

- (01/08)  Added initial implementation of Java gatekeeper/jobmanager. It is a
           full implementation of GRAM 1.0 protocol. The implementation 
           requires Java 1.3.1. Multiple users are supported but not setuid()
           support.

- (01/08)  Moved BaseServer.java class to net/ directory (from security
           directory) and updated depended classes.

- (12/16)  Misc. updates: updated host/service authentication, fixed rsl parser
           to handle quoted variable attributes (rsl_substitution) and to catch
           errors (unresolved variable references) during rsl evaluation.
	   Improved API for saving proxies.

- (12/04)  Explicit methods were added to set the default proxy credentials and
  	   default trusted certificates to use. Also, the GlobusProxy load() 
	   methods were updated to initialize a proxy with arbitrary sources of
	   trusted certificates. 

- (12/03)  Stream classes in org/globus/io/streams now extend from standard
	   Java IO stream classes.

- (12/03)  UrlCopy: progress reporting bug fixed (two fields were switched) and
	   added explicit methods for setting source and destination 
 	   credentials.

- (09/24)  More updates to GRAM library related to GRAM 1.5 protocol. 
	   The code was tested against the latest globus-beta code.

- (09/22)  Removed Netlogger.java from org/globus/util.

- (09/19)  The GRAM library was updated to support GRAM 1.5 protocol features.
	   A simple example was added to demonstrate most of the features.

- (09/18)  The setup program was slightly updated to use the new configuration code 
	   (CoGProperties.java) and fixed to support certificate directories for
	   trusted certificates.

- (09/17)  Added new graphical grid-proxy-init code into org/globus/tools/proxy.
	   The new code is now also integrated with the different demos.
	   The new code supports PKCS11 devices and is better integrated with the
	   new configuration code (CoGProperties.java)

- (09/16)  The ConfigUtil.java in org/globus/security was moved into
	   org/globus/util. The Config.java in org/globus/security is now
	   deprecated and replaced by CoGProperties.java in org/globus/common.

- (08/27)  Fixed the RSL parser to handle attributes with underscores in their
           names.

- (08/24)  Re-implemented the authorization framework. It is now more flexible as new
	   authorization code can be easily added and plugged into the existing code.

- (08/20)  Added support for multiple transfer listeners for the UrlCopy class.

-------------------------- 0.9.12 ---------------------------------------------------

- (08/15)  Updated the PKCS11 classes to support multiple credentials and integrated
	   the ProxyInit program with the new PKCS11 code. The new ProxyInit 
           program is able to generate a proxy from standard globus credentials 
           (from files) or directly from a PKCS11 device.

- (08/08)  Reimplemented GlobusRun tool to use the new RSL parser, and added support
	   for multiple GRAM submissions. This replaces the functionality of the 
 	   GramMultiJobRequest program. The GramMultiJobRequest program was removed
	   from the CVS along with the regular expression library and any reference
	   to it in the build files.

- (08/07)  Replaced the old RSL parser with a new more advanced version that 
	   supports parse trees, variable substitution, evaluation, and more. 
	   A new version of RslAttributes was also added (it is not entirely 
	   backwards compatible wit the old version, it was also moved to the
	   org.globus.rsl package) Also, a new class GramAttributes was added
	   to simplify operations on common GRAM attributes.

- (07/31)  Disabled SSL session management (session resume) in SSLClientConnection.	
	   It was causing problems with latest OpenSSL code. 

- (07/26)  Added makefiles to the org.globus.gos and org.globus.pkcs11.  The
	   pkcs11 makefile is only a dummy makefile at this point since we
           don't want this package to compile by default.

- (07/25)  Various updates to the io/streams and io/urlcopy classes. Mostly bug
	   fixes and minor enhancements. Factored out HTTPInput/OutputStream classes
	   from GassInput/OutputStream classes. Added supported for 'chunked' HTTP 
           downloads. Updated the gass server to properly decode urls and better
	   handle the relative vs. absolute file specifications.

- (07/25)  Changed org.globus.pkcs11.PKCS11Util so that the pkcs11 native dll is
           specified by a property rather than hardcoded.'

- (07/03)  Added preliminary pkcs11 support in the packages org.globus.pkcs11 and
           org.globus.pkcs11.tools.  This consists of two utility classes for dealing
           with pkcs11, and two programs: one to load Globus credentials onto pkcs11
           devices, and one to do a grid-proxy-init with credentials on pkcs11 devices.
           These packages require libraries from IBM available from alphaworks so
           these packages are not compiled by default at this time.

 - (07/03) Added a new tool for converting the Globus credentials to Java compatible
	   format - JKS supported by Sun. So the globus credentials can be used to
	   sign jar files.

 - (07/02) Gram updates: the rsl when sent over the wire is now properly quotified.
           Also, added the JOB_STATE_ALL mask to GRAM. Defined two functions in 
	   Util class to quotify and dequotify arbitrary strings.

 - (07/01) Fixed GlobusRun -f command to read the whole file instead of just the 
    	   first line.
 
 - (06/24) Moved GARA GUI stuff (workbench) to computingportals/gara/workbench.

 - (06/21) Improved error handling of the doDeleg() function in 
	   SSLClientConnection class. Now throws IOExceptions in case of an
	   error instead of displaying the error to stderr. Also added a
	   ChainedIOException class. Updated Gram and Gara to use the
	   updated function.

 - (06/12) Added JUnit testing library into the cvs. Implemented
	   first unit tests for MVHashtable class.
	   Also, removed jni/, attributes/, and blank/ directories
	   from CVS.

 - (06/11) MDS with GSI: Improved examples and provided more 
	   documentation.

 - (06/11) MyProxy: Added options for selecting host and subject 
	   authentication. Also, updated javadoc.

 - (06/08) GassServer: fixed the bug when redirected streams where 
	   not closed. Also, updated the JobOutputListener and 
	   JobOutputStream classes with a call to indicate the closing for a 
	   stream. The JobOutputListener interface was changed. It might 
	   require updates of the client code that uses that interface.

 - (06/08) Updates to MyProxy documentation in javadoc. It specifies more
	   clearly which version of MyProxy code is required and where
	   it can be obtained from.

 - (05/18) Updated the error messages for the GRAM client. Also implemented
	   -dryrun and -parse options for GlobusRun command-line tool.

 - (05/16) Proxy loading code was improved. Also, new API was added so the 
  	   proxy can now be loaded from an arbitrary input stream or a byte
 	   array.

 - (05/15) Minor updates the the globusrun program. The internal gass server
	   now runs with more specific options. Also added toString() 
	   function to the GassServer for debugging purposes.

 - (04/15) Added secure ldap client libraries for both Netscape LDAP SDK
 	   and JNDI/LDAP provider. Please read README file before using.
   
--------------------------- 0.9.11 --------------------------------------
    
 - (02/16) Added support for /dev/urandom device (where available) so 
	   the seed generation would be much faster. A significant
	   improvement of the initialization time of CoG Kit tools
	   and libraries should be visible on Linux machines or on
	   machines with that device is installed. If the device
	   is not installed the default seed generator will be used
	   just like before.

 - (02/09) Config.java was updated with better documentation and a small
           change for the GPDK that allows for it to disable the reading 
	   of the cog.properties. 

 - (02/08) Base64.java class was updated to the latest version.
  	   Also, a small bug in the SSLeayKeyHolder.java class was fixed
	   that prevented reading private keys with some text before the
	   BEGIN PRIVATE KEY line.

	   GlobusChainVerifier.java class was added to fix the problem
	   with the CA certificate with the extensions. It does what
	   the OpenSSL implementaion does - that is, ignores the CA
	   certificate that it received from the server and instead
	   compares it to the local copy of the CA certificate.

	   The SSLClientConnection was updated to use that new chain
	   verifier. The GSIServerSocketFactory does not need to be
	   updated at this point because it only trusts the user 
	   certificate. This might change in the future.

 - (01/30) SSLClientConnection class now is able to handle encrypted and 
	   unencrypted connections. The SSLEncClientConnection class 
           is obsolete and so is deleted from the CVS. To enable
	   encryption just call enableEncryption(true).

	   ProxyInit program is now also able to verify user certificate
 	   and CA certificate for signing. 

	   COG Version was updated to patch version 11.

	   Security classes were updated to automatically discover 
	   locations of CA certificates and proxy file. Also,
           the default trusted certificates are now cached in memory.
	   So if a new proxy is loaded, the trusted certificates do
	   no have to be re-loaded.

 - (01/19) Added size() and lastModified() functions to the FTP library.

 - (01/18) Fixed the windows scripts to work with COG_INSTALL_PATH that 
	   contains spaces in it. 

 - (01/17) Minor updates to the FTP library. Added socket timeouts and 
	   optimized the classes a bit for better efficiency.

 - (01/16) Added support for firewalls - creating server sockets within 
	   specified port ranges. The port range can be specified within
	   a cog.properites file or through the java system properties.

 - (01/15) Added ChainedException class and updated GlobusProxyException, 
	   GramException, MyProxyException to use that class for 
	   exception handling. It allows for chaining multiple exceptions
	   together. It helps to display more detailed messages and localize
	   errors faster.
	   Also, added Debug.out stream for displaying the debugging 
	   messages. All classes should use that stream to display its 
	   messages.

 - (01/04) Updated the FileInfo class to handle softlinks and spaces in
	   filenames.

 - (01/04) Improved ProxyInit and MyProxy to work with both unencrypted
           and encrypted private user keys.

 - (01/04) Added an extra parameter to the GRAM library for specifying
	   full vs. limited delegation. Also updated the globusrun program
	   with an new command line option for enabling the full delegation.
	   The limitedproxy property in the cog.properties file is no
	   longer supported.

 ------------------ 0.9.10 --------------------------------------------

	- (12/03) Improved GridProxyInit to have a better UI as Alain suggested.

	- (11/27) Added new SSLeayKeyHolder class that allows decrypting and 
		  encrypting SSLeay keys. Also implemented a 
                  grid-chage-pass-phrase program.

	- (11/23) Added a class that represents a remote gass server. Also 
                  updated the FTP library to support ASCII data transfers 
                  correctly.

	- (11/22) Added grid-cert-info program. Also updated 
                  SSLClientConnection class to perform better HOST 
                  authentication.

	- (11/21) Updated the Gass server to support enabling/disabling 
                  writting, reading, stdout/err redirection and added a new 
                  program globus-gass-server-shutdown. Updated FTP to perform 
                  host authentication by default. It can still be disabled 
                  by calling setHostAuthentication() method.

	- (11/20) Implemented two new programs grid-proxy-info and 
                  grid-proxy-destory.

	- (11/17) Updated FAQs with two more questions, updated build.xml 
                  file for ANT 1.2

	- (11/15) GSIFTP updates: added support for setting TCP socket 
                  buffers (local and remote) and added support for NLIST 
                  command for mgets() or copy() functions.

	- (10/16) Fixed minor problems with GassOutputStream. Only occured 
                  on Windows platorms.

	- (10/15) Updated the Gass Server program to have better command 
                  line interface.

	- (10/12) Added a Version class that returns current CoG version.

	- (10/11) Updated MyProxy tool to better reflect c client mesages. Also
		  a new proxy is always created for PUT operation.

	- (10/10) Minor changes to the mkprops.pl script to autodetect 
                  certificate directory.

   	- (10/10) Added FAQ.txt and README.txt files for binary distribution.
		  Fixed bunch of scripts to rely on the COG_INSTALL_PATH 
                  variable.

	- (9/27)  commited new configuration wizard that hopefully will 
                  simply the configuration of cog. with that also new batch 
                  and shell scripts where added for binary distribution. 

	- (9/27)  also added manifest file that is used internally by jar 
                  files. On windows machines it will start the configuration 
                  manager just by clicking on the jar file.

	- (9/22)  updates for MyProxy stuff: Added MyProxy program into tools
	  	  directory, implemented MyProxyTest and updated the MyProxy 
                  protocol to work with the latest MyProxy protocol. Also 
                  added batch and shell scripts for executing MyProxy tool.

	- (8/25)  directory structure changes: programs -> tools
                  and new io package.

	- (8/25)  added visual GridProxyInit program

	- (8/20)  updated FTP and GSIFTP client libraries for support of
	          common ftp client operations such as list(), mget(),

	- (7/11)  fixed trusted cert problem

	- (7/11)  moved a couple of proxy functions from CertUtil class to 
                  GlobusProxy (load(), save(), destroy(), etc.)

	- (7/11)  added better error messages to proxy init function

	- implemented the HOST authorization mechanism. it is only enabled 
          in GRAM. GSIFTP currently is not enabled to perform HOST 
          authorization.

	- fixed Gram to verify the protocol version of the messages

	- updated Gram to read error messages from a file. 

        - updated globusrun to support Globus 1.1.3 specifying the resource
          manager contact

	- updated GSIFTP client to work with latest GSIFTP server 
          (verion 0.4.0)

	- globusrun: removed -rsl option. now excepts the last argument 
          to be RSL

        - fixed the proxy_sign function and proxy generation NOT to copy 
          the certificate extentions

	- updated GassServer to provide an easy way to redirect job stdout/err
	  to a user specifed window. nice for cool demos.
	  [JobOutputStream and JobOutputListener classes introduced]

	- GSIFTP was rewritten to support both GSIFTPD servers and to support
          direct server-to-server file transfers
          
        - removed iaik provider dependencies in our server code so that
          switching ssl providers will be less painful. right now only 4
          files need to be changed: CertUtil, SSLClientConnection, 
          SSLServerConnection and Util (all in security directory)

        - proxy_sign and proxy init did not copy certificate extensions. 
	  [fixed but not in provider independent way]

	- add simple applets for job submission with output
          redirection and proxy generation. 

	- add simple applets to the cvs (proxy, job submission, gara?)

	- removed gsiftp client dependecy on the iaik class

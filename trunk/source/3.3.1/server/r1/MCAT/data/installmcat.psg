We no longer recommend the use of these scripts (but are leaving them
here as examples).  Instead, we recommend you do this in two separate
steps and run the psql commands by hand.  See README.MCAT.INSTALL.

#!/bin/csh
#  setup for postgres
# module load postgres
# Make sure the following has been setup properly:
# the ~/.odbc.ini file setup
# setenv PGDATA /scratch/slocal/pgsql/data
# setenv PATH /scratch/slocal/pgsql/bin:${PATH}
# setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/lib:/scratch/slocal/pgsql/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
#rm myinstall.results.psg mytest.results.psg
#
#  start with a clean database - NOTE: postmaster must be running
#
# if running not running on testbrick ( where postmaster running)
# psql -dDBName -h Hostname  <catalog.install.psg >& myinstall.results.psg
#
# if running this on the same host that postmaster is running, check your .odbc.ini file)
#psql testdb  <catalog.install.psg >& myinstall.results.psg
#
# add local stuff
# (cd ..;./my_ingest)
#diff {my,}install.results.psg
#wc *install.results.psg
#echo "installation completed. Successful if diff and wc results above are identical (modulo date/time)."
#setenv PATH ../bin:${PATH}
#echo "testing started - this may take a few minutes"
#./test.catalog >& mytest.results.psg
#diff {my,}test.results.psg
#wc *test.results.psg
#echo "testing completed. Successful if diff and wc results above are identical."
#echo "installation and testing completed."

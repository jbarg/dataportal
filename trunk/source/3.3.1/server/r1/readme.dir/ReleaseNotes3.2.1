SRB 3.2.1
</h3>

This document describes changes for SRB 3.2.1, released August 13,
2004.
<p>

SRB 3.2.1 is 3.2 with three server-side bug fixes.  For everything on
client-side, you can still use the 3.2 version.  The server fixes are:

<ol>
<li>sys admin bugs such as sys admin not being able to use
"Srmtrash -A" to empty other user's trash.

<li>Possible server core dump when a user uses a logical resource that
contains several resouces of the same class.

<li>Error when installing MCAT from scratch caused by not including
2 new resource attributes in 3.2.
</ol>

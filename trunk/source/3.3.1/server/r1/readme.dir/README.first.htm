IMPORTANT NOTES: 

i) Starting with SRB 2.0.0, installation procedures have been changed
to use the "configure" script. Please read README.build for details.
Starting with 2.1.1, there is now an install.pl script to handle certain 
types of installations.
ii) The Sput and Sget commands support parallel I/O. But the DEFAULT I/O
mode is SERIAL. Please use the -m option or set the env variable "srbParallel"
to any value to switch the I/O mode to parallel.   With 2.1, the server
can be configured with the number of parallel threads to use.
iii) The previous versions (1.1.8) of MCAT are not compatible with the
2.0 and 2.1 releases.  At SDSC, we are starting to upgrade the MCATs
of various projects to 2.x.  If you are using one of the MCATs at
SDSC, please email srb@sdsc.edu for the status of the MCAT upgrade.
 
See the ReleaseNotesX.Y[.Z] files (for example, ReleaseNotes2.1.1) for
features of the releases.

SRB_Install_Notes.doc - This is an excellent SRB installation note written 
by Dr. Michael Doherty of the e-Science Group at the Rutherford Appleton 
Laboratory of UK. It describes from start to finish the installation of MCAT, 
MES (MCAT enable server), other SRB resource servers and client softwares.
The install note is based on a Linux system with Oracle 9i as the database
for MCAT. However, most of the note is applicable to other OS and

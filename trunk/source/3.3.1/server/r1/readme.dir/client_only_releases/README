This is a client-only release of the SRB code.

Although SRB is freely available to gov and edu sites, there are some
restrictions to commercial sites and so our full release requires a
decryption key (see our web site).  For this client-only release,
however, we are able to make it available without encryption.

The purpose of this is to make it easier for people to build SRB
client programs and API libraries.  But to use these, you will need to
to set up the SRB environment files to connect to an SRB server system
of your choice.

For more information, see the readme.dir documents and/or the SRB
web site at http://www.sdsc.edu/srb/

To build:

1) ./configure

If you want to use Grid Security Infrastructure authentication,
include --enable-gsi-auth and --enable-globus-location=<path>

2) gmake

You should then have the Scommands under utilities/bin.

3) Copy the utilities/bin to your install directory (or use them in
the current location); there is no 'gmake install' for the utilities.

4) If you want to make use of the unixIO interface, for example for
the linking with MDSPlus, cd to unixIO and run gmake.  You then
configure MDSPlus specifying this unixIO subdirectory (--with-srb=).

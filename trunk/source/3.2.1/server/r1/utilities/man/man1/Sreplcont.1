.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "Sreplcont "
Replicates a container copy to a specific resource. For containers
that have multiple "permanent" and "cache" copies, this is a way
to put a copy of the container on a specific resource. For
example, if a container was created in multiple "cache" resources,
this is a way to stage this container on a "cache" resource that
is not designated as "primary". The specified
.I resource
must be one of the physical resources used to recreate the
container (i.e., the specified resource must belong to the logical
resource used to create the container).

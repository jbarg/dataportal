  <H2>What is the Matrix Client API</H2>
  Some classes that are used to take away most tedium from using auto generated
  JAXB classes, and remove the details of needing to handle marshalling and
  unmarshalling and SOAP requests. Using the API, developers should be able to
  focus on their application logic, instead of the details of correctly talking
  to a Matrix server.
  <BR/><BR/>
  <H2>How to Use it</H2>
  First, take a look at the schema srb.xsd, and understand what it is.Look at the example code for using the Client API in
examples/ClientXXXTest.sh.
  <H2>Some Interesting Stuff you may want/have to know<br/>
      More *'s means more important</H2>
  1. * Although most of the classes allow setXXX methods, you should only use them for
  non-required parameters, and useXXX methods for required parameters, since the
  useXXX parameters guarantee that the resulting object will be a valid
  content tree.<br/><br/>
  2. ** When creating a UserInfo object, the setXXX methods should probably be used
  to set the HomeDirectory, ChallengeResponse (password), and
  DefaultStorageResouce fields. Although these are optional fields for a valid
  request, they are probably needed.<br/><br/>
  3. ** Right now, when creating a Step, the optional field StepName must be set
  for an operation to be performed by the server. (e.g.
  step.setStepName("createOp") ). The list of valid StepNames follow:
  <ul>
		<li>copyOp</li>
		<li>createOp</li>
		<li>deleteOp</li>
		<li>downloadDataSetOp</li>
		<li>ingestOp</li>
		<li>listOp</li>
		<li>prepareTicketOp</li>
		<li>renameOp</li>
		<li>replicateOp</li>
		<li>seekNReadOp</li>
		<li>seekNWriteOp</li>
  </UL>

  4. * You need to have a matrix server running somewhere.
  <p>&nbsp;5. ** Communication to the server can be done by first setting up a DataGridRequest.
  A DataGridRequest looks like this:</p>
  <pre>
  DataGridRequest
    |_DocMeta (type DocMeta)
    |_GridUser (type UserInfo)
    |_VOInfo (type VirtualOrganizationInfo)
    |_Transaction/TransactionStatusQuery (Transaction when making requests)
    |_FaultHandler (type FaultHandlers - not used for now)

  </pre>
  An example operation might be one for creating a new Collection. So first the
  user has to set up a DocMeta, GridUser, VOInfo, and FaultHandler, all of which
  should be straightforward by looking at the API and the provided examples.

  Then the actual operation object needs to be created which is a little harder.
  The user will create an Op from the bottom up, starting from smaller objects
  like StdDatagridObject and building some form of Params and then the final
  Operation.

  Required parameters for any object are passed to the constructor and the user
  can set any optional parameters (which might actually be <i>required</I> for
  that particular purpose through the set methods).

  After a DataGridRequest object has been created, a MatrixConnection object can
  be created and the request sent through it.<br/><br/>

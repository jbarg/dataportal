									<p>Your shopping basket will show all your selected studies, data sets and data files and will keep the information until you explicitly delete it. You have the possibility to sort your entries either by name or by the date they have been added to the shopping cart.
</p>
<p>Generally you have the following options for all entries in your shopping cart:

</p>

<ul>
	<li>Delete the item</li>
	<li>Transfer/Download an item</li>
	<li>Re send the query that got this item</li>
	<li>Add personal notes to a particular file (e.g. as to why you wanted it) and view the query information</li>
<li>Manipulate the item (if available)</li>
<li>View the date that it was added</li>
	
</ul>
<p>You have the possibility to either delete only selected entries - click on the delete field behind the entry and then on the delete button beneath this column. Otherwise you can delete the complete content of the shopping basket by clicking on the delete all contents button at the bottom of the page. </p>


<p>Currently items (files and datasets) can only be downloaded and transfered.  The Data Portal currenty can retrieve items from SRB, HTTP, GridFTP GASS and FTP severs and transfer them to GridFTP GASS and FTP severs or just to download to your machine.  To do this press the 'transfer' button which will take to the <a href="Transfer.html">transfer</a> page. 

</p>
<p>For each item in the shopping basket you have the possibility to add your personal comments e.g. what you have done to the selected file, why you have selected it or what you wanted to do next. If you click on the view button it will show you all existing comments you have recorded and also gives you the opportunity to add, change or delete them. Please note that these functionalities are only rudimentary and do not offer a fully fledge word processing service.</p>

<p>   For each selected item the initial query for study is preserved. If you press the Ok button it will repeat this request and show you the up to date information about this study. You can then either explore this study again or return to your shopping basket.
 

</p>
<p>On certain items you can use more services on the data.  For examle some data allows manipulate services.  On this page you will find a list of base parameters, which can be restricted (mainly date, place and here altitude). For each of them a valid value range is given to aid the selection process. In addition you can select specific countries at the bottom of the page to help with the selection of the correct latitude and longitude boundaries. Once you have set your boundary conditions you can then go on to the manipulation, currently you can select to calculate the minimum, maximum and average of the available parameters e.g. temperature. When you have selected and filled all the required fields press calculate and the result will appear at the bottom of the page.

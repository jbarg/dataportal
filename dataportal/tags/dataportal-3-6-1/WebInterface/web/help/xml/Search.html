									<p>This is a simple search, which uses some of the information in the central catalogue to narrow down the search to some relevant experimental data</p>
<p>The search has three stages: first the facility and disciplines are selected, then the studies within those disciplines and finally the experiments within those studies.


</p>
<p>Use the basic search to narrow down the search to particular data within studies in a discipline available within a specific facility.
</p>
<p>First select the facility from the drop down list. As you can see BADC is the initial selection. You can also choose additional facilities e.g. the MPIM in Hamburg, which hold similar data to the BADC and search both facilities at the same time. When choosing a discipline the search parameters will be automatically expanded providing more key words in the list to describe the exact discipline you are interested in
</p>

<p>The disciplines you have chosen are displayed to the right of the discipline list. You have to choose four disciplines for the BADC facility in order to narrow your search sufficiently to be able to complete the basic search. You will know when you have chosen sufficient disciplines because the discipline box will only have one entry, '---Back ---'.

You can select another Facility or Discipline at any time from the pull down menu or list.

</p>

<p>You have the option to limit the time taken for the query to return your results. The default time is 10 seconds and normally should be long enough. But sometimes, for example, through slow network connections this might take longer than expected. Therefore you can limiting the time for the query or click on no maximum which will return the results whenever all the information from each facility is returned.



</p>
<p>When you have chosen four disciplines, the Submit button is displayed so that you can submit your query. This will then lead you to the next stage.</p>
<p>
The next stage is Select a study name.</p>

<p>The final stage is Select the Experiments.</p>

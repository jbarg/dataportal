</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Central Laboratory of the Research Councils (CLRC) in the UK is one of Europe's largest multidisciplinary research support organisations. From its three sites, CLRC operates several large scale scientific facilities for the UK research and industrial community including accelerators, lasers, telescopes, satellites and supercomputers which all create copious quantities of data. Currently CLRC is holding data in access of 50 TB, deployed through a number of data centres including 1 World Data Centre, 3 National Data Centres and a range of facilities for particular communities or instruments. However, it is expected that much more data will be collected in the future with the advent of new instruments, facilities (diamond) and projects (LHC Challenge), which will lead to data volumes in excess of several PB within the next 5-6 years. The data held at CLRC covers most major science areas e.g. Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science and Physics. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Currently the scientists are forced to manually relate between all the experimental, data, computing and analysis facilities that are available world wide, with little infrastructure support (</FONT><A HREF="#Figure1">Figure1</A><FONT FACE="Palatino"> Current situation). </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the future it is hoped the Grid will provide these functions, enabling the scientists to choose much more easily from a wide range of services, connecting and combining desired services for an optimal working environment. Much of the access to the Grid is envisaged to take place through customisable, community oriented Portals (<B>Figure 2</B> )</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A range of projects are providing the initial building blocks of an integrated solution for users of experimental, computing and data facilities, demonstrating on a few selected examples how basic technologies can be used to build middleware components that support high level scientific grid applications (see <B>Figure 3</B> ).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;<IMG SRC="figure3.jpg" WIDTH=623 HEIGHT=467></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fig. 3.</B> Building Blocks for an Integrated Solution</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Data will play a pivotal role in the success of Grid or e-Science developments. Virtually all envisaged applications will need to be able to draw from and deliver to the distributed heterogeneous information/data sources with a variety of contents. Hence three major challenges are posed: data accessibility, data transfer and management of personal data. Data accessibility implies the capability to locate information/data without prior knowledge of its physical location or the form in which its contents is described. Furthermore scientists, as well as applications, need to be able to combine results from different sources. Data transfer relates to the problem of large data volumes that need to be transferred across the Internet. Management of personal data is concerned with the growing distribution of data produced by scientists within a Grid environment, which required new ways of keeping track and moving data for single scientists and more importantly for research groups. CLRC's integrated data system includes the following components a DataPortal for high-level access to multidisciplinary data, linking to existing data catalogue systems. These catalogues include metadata as well as links to the data itself. The data itself is held in various storage resources from local disks, over databases to multi terabyte tertiary tape systems. To make the solution independent from the physical location(s) of the data we have introduced the Storage Resource Broker (SRB) from the San Diego Supercomputing Centre. The catalogues hold logical links into SRB, which SRB resolves into physical links to the data. To reduce and manipulate the data before shipping we have installed the RasDaMan software developed by Active Knowledge. See <B>Figure 4</B> with an example for earth science (es) data.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fig 4.: </B>Integrated solution for data access to environmental data</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DataPortal is only the initial port of call to search for and retrieve data from CLRC and other connected data holdings. Please see Figure 5 Query hierarchy for a general overview of the location of information. The transition from querying the main CLRC metadata catalogue to the local catalogues will be completely transparent to you.</P>

Incoming requests from the user will be interpreted by the server and a query will be formed and transmitted either to the Central Metadata Catalogue or the connected local Metadata Repositories. Currently queries to local repositories have a SQL like notation and are transmitted via http. The result from the various local repositories and the Central Catalogue is expected in XML format. The response generator will collate the results and user output generator will produce the required pages to display the results. The Server is also responsible for the user authentication and session control.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CLRC has developed a special multidisciplinary metadata format to be able to integrate and make available data from various scientific topics ranging from astronomy to physics. General information about the type of data held within CLRC and connected sites are kept in the General Metadata Repository, however more detailed information needs to be extracted from local repositories. In the following paragraph we will describe how these resources are connected with the server (see also <B>Figure 18</B> ).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other repositories are expected to have either their own metadata catalogue systems and their own metadata formats describing their data holding or use an extension of the CLRC metadata format. To integrate them each catalogue will be accompanied by an XML wrapper, which interprets the requests of the Data Portal server and translates them into local SQL and metadata formats. If the reply consists solely of metadata information the XML output generator and the Response generator will provide a collated XML document to the Data Portal server, with the included metadata translated back into the general metadata format. Does the request also include the wish for actual data, these will be transferred separately and the XML document returned to the server will include the necessary information. Currently the metadata catalogues include hard links to the physical data location, this site will be contacted and the data transferred via http to the user. <B>Figure 18</B> depicts the integration of the BADC data.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The core DataPortal system offers the user the possibility to collect all relevant datasets in his personal shopping basket, which can be kept from one session to the next if required. This shopping basket than offers the user a range of functionalities like download (using http), delete (from shopping basket) or if available manipulate. Datasets have to be marked in their metadata database for the Portal to know a manipulation service is available. In the case of the BADC this manipulation is the link to RasDaMan. The user is guided to a manipulation interface, which interacts both with the metadata database (via the XML wrapper) for general information about the dataset as well as the Gribservelet, which enables the interaction with the RasDaMan database. Both the Gribservelet and the XML wrapper are implemented as Grid services (see <B>Figure 19</B> ). </P>

<FONT FACE="Palatino"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RasDaMan is a database management system specialising in raster data. The data in question is analysed and loaded into the database system. During the loading process the data is split up in suitably sized blobs (binary large object) and stored together with content relevant information. The user has than the possibility to query, manipulate and extract the inserted information based on his own requirements. The user can e.g. extract only selected information for example only temperature values for a certain area of the globe, but not all the other parameters stored in the file nor the information for other countries. Thus he can limit the finally extracted data dramatically. Furthermore mathematical manipulations and analysis can be carried out on the selected data e.g. max temperature for the UK on the 1/1/2000. The way to retrieve these information from RasDaMan is to use their own SQL like query language. However we have decided that it would be too inconvenient for most users to learn the language and have therefore provide an interface which gives access to some of the functionalities via simple menus.</P>

									<p>	Certificates uploaded into a MyProxy server have only a limited lifetime for security reasons, therefore you should make sure that yours is still valid. If in doubt just re-upload your certificate it will replace any existing certificates. When up loading your certificate you can decide, which lifetime it should have. If you would like to use CCLRC's MyProxy server you can upload your certificate by going to the login page of the DataPortal and click on e-Minerals Proxy. This will open the DataPortal Proxy tool.</p>									</blockquote>

When finished please select 'Next' to go on to the next step.

You will than go back to the Configuring Certification Authorities (CA) page. Please press 'Next' to proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>The tool has now all the information it need's to create a temporary proxy file. The name and the location where the tool intends to place it will be shown to you on the Configuring Proxy File web page. Please check that you have write access to the chosen location, otherwise click on '..' to chose a more appropriate name or location. Press 'Select' to confirm you new choice, this will take you back to the Configuring Proxy File page. Now click on 'Finish' to complete the installation of the Java Cog Kit.

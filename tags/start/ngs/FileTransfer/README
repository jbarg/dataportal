File Transfer Tool for NGS Portal
=================================

File Transfer Tool for NGS Portal is based on gridftpclient xportlet from the
Extreme! Computing Lab (http://www.extreme.indiana.edu). It is now re-designed
as a CHEF tool to perform uploading, downloading, third party transferring,
deleting for both files and directories. For third party transferring, all files
larger than 1 MB will be transferred in parallel mode for better performance.

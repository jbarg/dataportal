<p>The NGS is the core UK grid, intended for the production use of computational and data grid resources. NGS is the core service resulting from the UK's e-Science programme. NGS is supported by JISC, and is run by the Grid Operations Centre (GOC). The sister organisation of GOC, the UK e-Science Engineering Task Force (ETF) is responsible for developing the future grid services via the e-Science research grid.</p>

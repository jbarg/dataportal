Proxy Manager Tool for NGS Portal
=================================

Proxy Manager Tool for NGS Portal is based on proxymanager xportlet from the
Extreme! Computing Lab (http://www.extreme.indiana.edu). It is now re-designed
as a CHEF tool to retrieve and manage GSI proxy credentials from MyProxy server.

Proxy Manager Tool can also display the GSI proxy credential retrieved by the
GridService service (org.chefproject.service.GridService).

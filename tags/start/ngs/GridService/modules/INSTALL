 o Put Java CoG and ProxyManager libraries under "modules/lib"
 o Shutdown Tomcat if it is running
 o Execute "ant dist" under ${chef.home} and the CHEF library including this
   GridService module will be created under "${chef.home}/dist/lib", it can then
   be deployed to Tomcat

   for this GridService Module which will be under "modules/lib/". It can then
   be deployed to Tomcat, notice CHEF also needs to be deployed
 o Execute "ant deploy" to deploy, you also need all libraries defined by
   "chef-portal.home", "chef-src.home", "jars" and "module-mgrid" copied to CHEF

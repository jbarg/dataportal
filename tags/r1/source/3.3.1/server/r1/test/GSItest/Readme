These source files are some old test routines that I (Wayne) had
written and used when I developed the AID library back in 1999.  More
recently (early 2004) Ananta used and modified these for the
extensions he made to the AID library for delegation.  Since they may
come in handy, both for developers and others, I decided to include
them in the source repository.  Of course, they are just test
programs, with sections added and commented out, etc.

aidc.c is an AID Client test program
aids.c is an AID Server test program
aids2.c is a 2nd AID Server test program
../../src/lib/aid.c is the AID library; it is built again via this
    Makefile (producing a aid.o in this directory to use) 
    to give it the -DAID_TIMING option on the cc line.

Before running, you need to set your GSI environment.  At
SDSC this would be accomplished via something like this:
  setenv GLOBUS_LOCATION /usr/local/apps/nmi-2.1
  source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.csh

The Makefile here should work OK, at least on Linux:
  gmake clean
and
  gmake
should work fine and produce aidc, aids, and aids2.

Before running them, do a grid-proxy-init to get a proxy certificate.

As a test, we run three windows.  In our case, we were running
each window on host "zuri" and the following commandlines worked:

  aids -p 31002 -g

  aids2 -p 31001 -p2 31002 -g -server2DN "notNecessaryNow" -host2 "zuri" -msg "hellooo"

and

  aidc -port 31001 zuri "notNecessaryNow" hello1

The programs display some messages about what they are doing, along with
some timing information.

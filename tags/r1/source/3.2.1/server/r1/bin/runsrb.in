# and configuration files are located. The dafault is ../data.
# srbData=/projects/diglib/srb/SRB1_1_8Lock/data. 

# NSL_UNITREE_DIR defines the directory where the UniTree configuration 
# files can be found. This line should be commented out if this SRB does 
# not support UniTree access.

# srbKeytabName specifies the path where the SRB's DCE keytab file is located.
# This line should be commented out if this SRB does not support HPSS access.
# srbKeytabName=/users/sy/srb/private/.ktb_srb

# srbPrincipalName specifies DCE principal name. This is to be used together
# with srbKeytabName for DCE authentication of the SRB user.
# This line should be commented out if this SRB does not support HPSS access.
# srbPrincipalName=srb

# srbNoDCELogin specifies whether the SRB should carry out DCE login during
# startup. The default action (without defining srbNoDCELogin) is to
# do DCE login. This option is useful when the DCE login daemon is not
# functioning properly and you still want the SRB server to service requests
# other than HPSS.
# srbNoDCELogin=1

# hpssCOSId specifies the class id to be used for creating hpss files
# hpssCOSId=10

# HPSS_LS_NAME - This parameter specify the path for the LS (Location Server). 
# This is only needed if the default path is not built into the hpss library.
# You should check with your HPSS administrator regarding the parameter.
# This feature is valid only for version 4 of HPSS.
# HPSS_LS_NAME=/.../mob.llnl.gov/subsys/hpss/ls/group

# HPSS_SERVER_HOST - This parameter is valid only if this SRB server is
# HPSS enabled and uses NON-DCE for authentication. It specifies the
# HPSS server host/port_no if it is not the same as the default that built
# into the hpss library.
# HPSS_SERVER_HOST=hpss07i/1218

# HPSS_HOSTNAME is the env variable for the client host name used for TCP/IP

# METADATA_FKREL specifies the location of the metadata.fkrel file.

# SHOW_MCAT_QUERY is an environment variable that specifies whether the

# If not needed comment out this variable.

# AUDIT_LEVEL is an environment variable that specifies whether to audit
# operations in SRB and if so at what level.
# Level 0  =  no auditing
# Level 1  =  anonymous auditing, userid zero unless user specifies with flag.
# Level 2  =  owner auditing, owner specifies which files require auditing.
# Level 3  =  full auditing, audit no matter what.
# If not needed, comment out this variable.
# AUDIT_LEVEL=1

# GENERATE_GUID is an environment variable that specifies whether a 
# GlobalIdentifier will generated and stored as part of a srbObject 
# registration.
# if the value is undefined  or "NO_AUTO_GUID" then no GUID is generated.
# if the value is "STORE_AUTO_GUID" then SRB generates a GUID and stores it as
# part of system metadata. A user can insert or update GUID after 
# registartion also.
# If not needed, comment out this variable.
# If you do use "STORE_AUTO_GUID" you should first replace src/lib/gen_uuid.c
# with the version at http://www.npaci.edu/DICE/SRB/tarfiles/gen_uuid.c; see
# either source file for more information.
# GENERATE_GUID=NO_AUTO_GUID
# GENERATE_GUID=STORE_AUTO_GUID

# ALLOW_NON_CHECKING_REGISTERY_OF_DATA is an environment variable that
# specifies whether to allow users to register data without checking
# if SRB is allowed to access it. Note that this can be a security hole.
# If not needed comment out this variable.
# ALLOW_NON_CHECKING_REGISTERY_OF_DATA=1


# PRE_SPAWN_CNT defines the number of srbServer to prespawn. If it is not
# defined, a value of 0 is assumed. The purpose of prespawning server is
# to improve interactivity. However, to prevent spawning a large number of
# idle servers, it is recommended that only the MCAT enabled servers should
# be prespawned.

# MaxThread defines the maximum number of threads to use for parallel
# transfer. The default is 4. Currently MaxThread cannot be set larger than
# 16
# MaxThread=16

# SizePerThread is used to calculate the number of threads to use based
# on the size of the file being transfered.
# numThreads = size/SizePerThread. SizePerThread is should be input
# in units of MBytes. The default value is 30 (30 MBytes).
# SizePerThread=2

# X509_USER_KEY and X509_USER_CERT specify where the SRB server's GSI

# ServerTimeOut - This allows the srbServer process to timeout and exit if
# it has not received new commands from the connecting client/server for
# the number of seconds specified by ServerTimeOut. The ServerTimeOut vaule
# must not be too small especially on a MCAT enabled server because the
# connecting server may be busy transferring a very large file. Internally
# ServerTimeOut defaults to 1800 sec if it is set to less than this value.

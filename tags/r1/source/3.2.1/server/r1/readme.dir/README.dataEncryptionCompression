Data Encryption and/or Compression is a new feature of SRB 2.1.

To build with the data encryption system, you need to include
--enable-secure-comm on the configure line.  

You also need to supply the locations of the OpenSSL libraries, which
can be via Globus or OpenSSL:

If you've installed Globus (via NMI, for example), the SRB
configure/build system can use the libraries under the
GLOBUS_LOCATION.  If the configure default GLOBUS_LOCATION is correct
for your system, all you need is the --enable-secure-comm.  Otherwise,
you can specify the globus location via
--enable-globus-location=path.

If you haven't installed Globus, you can use OpenSSL directly.
OpenSSL (www.openssl.org) is an excellent package and is fairly easy
to build and install.  Then, on the configure line, include
--enable-openssl-location=path.

You may need to update Sput.pl and Sget.pl for the location of OpenSSL
on your system.  This is near the top of each script.

See http://www.npaci.edu/dice/srb/SecureAndOrCompressedData.html
for a description of the system.

The user utilities for this system are perl scripts,
utilities/bin/Sput.pl and utilities/bin/Sget.pl.  The command lines
are described on the above SecureAndOrCompressedData.html web page and
via the scripts' usage text.

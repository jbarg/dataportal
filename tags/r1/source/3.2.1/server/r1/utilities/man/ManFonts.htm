 Macros to set fonts
 -------------------
 
    The standard font is roman; the default text size is 10 point.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .SM [text]</EM>
      Set the text on the same line or the text on the next line in a
      font that is one point size smaller than the default font.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .SB [text]</EM>
      Set the text on the same line or the text on the next line in
      boldface font, one point size smaller than the default font.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .BI text</EM>
      Set its arguments alternately in bold face and italic.  Thus,
 
 
           .BI this "word and" that
 
      would set "this" and "that" in bold face, and "word and" in
      italics.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .IB text</EM>
      Set its arguments alternately in italic and bold face.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .RI text</EM>
      Set its arguments alternately in roman and italic.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .IR text</EM>
      Set its arguments alternately in italic and roman.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .BR text</EM>
      Set its arguments alternately in bold face and roman.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .RB text</EM>
      Set its arguments alternately in roman and bold face.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .R [text]</EM>
      Set TEXT in roman font.  If no text is present on the line where
      the macro is called, then the text of the next line appears in
      roman.  This is the default font to which text is returned at the
      end of processing of the other macros.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .B [text]</EM>
      Set TEXT in bold face.  If no text is present on the line where
      the macro is called, then the text of the next line appears in bold
      face.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .I [text]</EM>
      Set TEXT in italic.  If no text is present on the line where the
      macro is called, then the text of the next line appears in italic.

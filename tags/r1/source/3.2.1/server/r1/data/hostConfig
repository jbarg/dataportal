# This is the optional SRB host configuration file. This is normally not
# needed since the SRB now gets the hostNames from the Resource tables 
# registered in MCAT. You only need this file only when you want to 
# add aliases to your local hostName. The SRB server uses the gethostbyname()
# to get the local host addresses and tries to match them with those 
# registered with MCAT to determine which resources are controlled by this
# SRB. There are situations where the local host address registered with MCAT 
# may not show up with this call. The beginning of the data/srbLog file
# shows all local host addresses recognized by this SRB server. If the local
# host address registered with MCAT does not show up in this list, you should 
# add a line with in this file with two entries. The first entry must be 
# the keyword "localhost" followed by the local host address registered 
# with MCAT. For example: 
# localhost srb srb.sdsc.edu
# localhost srb srb.sdsc.edu miner miner.sdsc.edu
localhost senne senne.dl.ac.uk

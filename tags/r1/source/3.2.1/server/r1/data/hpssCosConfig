# This is the HPSS COS (class of service) configuration file. This file
# is needed only if this SRB server is HPSS enabled (i.e., HPSS defined)
# in the mk.config file. The COS definition should be entered one COS
# per line. Each line should have two or three entries. The first entry
# is the Class of Service ID followed by the Maximum file size in 
# KBytes of this COS. The optional third entry may contain the keyword 
# "default_cos" which indicates that this COS is the default COS. i.e., the 
# "size" input of the srbObjCreate call is unknown (-1), this class will be 
# chosen.

SRB 2.1.2
---------

This document describes changes for SRB 2.1.2, released on August 12,
2003.  This is an intermediate release containing mostly bug fixes.

Although it has only been about a month since our previous release
(2.1.1, July 14), we wanted to distribute this now in preparation for
our SRB 3.0 release in a few weeks.  The 3.0 release will contain many
changes to support the Federated MCAT/SRB "Zones" capabilities.  (We
were going to call this SRB 2.2, but changed to 3.0 since it will
contain significant new features.)

This current release also contains SRB Matrix 1.1.2 (matching SRB
2.1.2, one major version number different) as described later in this
document.

Very briefly, the more significant bug fixes are:

  Fixed the configure script to remove the inaccurate portions of
  the --help output.

  Sbload parsing improved to handle command-line wildcards that expand
  to very large numbers of files.

  Sbunload parsing improved to handle blanks in file names.

  For parallel Sget -f, files will always be correct size (it will
  truncate the local file first, if it already exists, in case the
  replacement is smaller).

  Schmod fixed to handle a large (>300) number of subcollections in
  a collection (avoid a core dump).
  
  Fixed a problem where a parallel transfer would 
  occasionally fail with a INP_ERR_DESC error (added a lock).

  Fixed a problem where the srbMaster would occasionally hang on a
  pipe read from the srbServer causing everything to hang.

  Fix a problem where files stored to a postgres MCAT with the string
  'offset' as part of the filename, would fail.

  Configure now checks for another type of Globus installation, gcc32dbg,
  for sites using a debug build of GSI (five installation types are now
  checked for).

Also see our bugs page at: http://www.npaci.edu/dice/srb/bugs.html
for current bugs as well as links to lists of fixed bugs.


New features:

  The system now supports access to HPSS from Linux SRB servers.  This
  is the DCEless HPSS driver.

  There is a new Sufmeta command, for User Friendly Meta data management.
  'Sufmeta' provides usage information (there is not yet a man page).


As always, also see our home page at http://www.npaci.edu/dice/srb/
for additional information.  Also see
http://www.npaci.edu/dice/srb/CurrentSRB/ReleaseNotes2.1.1.htm for the
previous, 2.1.1, release notes.



Matrix New Features: (version 1.1.2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Java Matrix Client API:
A java client API has been added. The java API and the java docs can
be built using the Ant script provided with the matrix release. This
API allows Java developers to develop data grid applications and XML
Web services without any prior knowledge of web services or XML
Schema.  The API prepares the SOAP message as an XML document oriented
web services. The SRB operations could be invoked using this
API. Refer the Client-Readme.html file in the matrix/docs directory.

2) Multiple Flow support:
Matrix uses "Data Grid Language (DGL)" to support execution of
operations on a data grid. This could be considered analogous to long
run transactions using the "Structured Query Language" (SQL) on a
database.

SQL:data base ::=:: DGL: data grid

In DGL, a data grid transaction request consists of multiple
flows. Each flow could be either parallel or sequential and can have
multiple steps (operations). The current release supports multiple
flows which could be either sequential or parallel.

3) Tomcat / Any servlet container
The previous version required downloading JWSDP. The current version
can be used on any servlet container like Apache Tomcat or JBoss,
etc.,.  We have tested only on Apache Tomcat (Catalina).


Matrix Bugs Cleared:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Schema
Changes in schema to facilitate user-defined meta data schema (out
side MCAT). Even though the Matrix design had this as a requirement,
the schema did not reflect it earlier.

2) Connection Bug
Previously there was bug that made an unnecessary Datagrid request the
first time a connection was made. This has been removed.

Matrix Next release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We are growing fast and trying to make our selves as first in "datagrid
services". We also helping other institutions with our ideas do develop
similar infrastructure. The next release of Matrix will be version 2.0
along with SRB 3.0 (Matrix versions are 1.0 behind SRB). It will have
facilities to:
- An Overview of Matrix Architecture and features
- Query SRB MCAT using a subset of W3C XQuery
- OGSA preliminary release (Matrix Factory)
- JSP reference implementation for developers (Web Interface)
- Improved logging control
- Sample Web Interface for demo-ing the use of "Data Grid Language" in data
grids and scientific pipeline processing.

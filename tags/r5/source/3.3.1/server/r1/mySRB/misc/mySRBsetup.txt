1. Change the constants #defined in mainalpha1.c.
   See explanantion in the mySRBCall comments in mainalpha1.c.

2. In the directory set for LOGDIR create a directory called 'serverlog'.
   Give read/write permission to the "account" that will run the cgi-script. 
   LOGDIR should also have read/write permission for this "account".

3. In $LOGDIR/serverlog   create two files:
      serverid
      ticketuserid
   Make these two files readable by the "account" that runs your cgi programs.

   serverid will have three lines with the following information (no blanks)
      srbadmin-user-name
      srbadmin-user-domain
      srbadmin-user-password

   serverid file will be used when making "new" accounts. If you are blocking
   this feature, then this file need not be there.

   ticketuserid will have three lines with following information (no blanks)
      ticketuser-name
      ticketuser-domain
      ticketuser-password

   ticketuserid will be used when connecting using tickets. If you are blocking
   this feature, then this file need not be there.

4. Change the pathnames 'set'  in sample_script or sample_script_gsi. Copy the
   lang subdirectory to the appropriate location.

5. compile sample_main.c using sample_script if your SRB is not compiled with
   GSI; otherwise use sample_script_gsi. Note that for GSI-enabled mySRB,
   several additional pathnames for GSI and AID libraries must be set correctly.

6. identify your web-server master document directory and cgi-bin directories.

7. copy the contents of the webserverdir directory to your master document
   directory.

8. mysrb3.cgi is a cgi program generated by sample_script(_gsi) and must remain
   named mysrb3.cgi. Copy mysrb3.cgi, srberror.cgi, srberror2.cgi, srberror3.cgi,
   and Serror into the cgi-bin directory.

9. Start using mySRB :-)

<H1><EM>(groff)</EM> Man usage</H1><PRE> 
    This section describes the available macros for manual pages.  For
 further customization, put additional macros and requests into the file
 `man.local' which is loaded immediately after the `man' package.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .TH title section [extra1] [extra2] [extra3]</EM>
      Set the title of the man page to TITLE and the section to SECTION,
      which must have a value between 1 and 8.  The value of SECTION may
      also have a string appended, e.g. `.pm', to indicate a specific
      subsection of the man pages.
 
      Both TITLE and SECTION are positioned at the left and right in the
      header line (with SECTION in parentheses immediately appended to
      TITLE.  EXTRA1 is positioned in the middle of the footer line.
      EXTRA2 is positioned at the left in the footer line (or at the
      left on even pages and at the right on odd pages if double-sided
      printing is active).  EXTRA3 is centered in the header line.
 
      For HTML output, headers and footers are completely suppressed.
 
      Additionally, this macro starts a new page; the new line number
      is 1 again (except if the `-rC1' option is given on the command
      line) - this feature is intended only for formatting multiple man
      pages; a single man page should contain exactly one `TH' macro at
      the beginning of the file.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .SH [heading]</EM>
      Set up an unnumbered section heading sticking out to the left.
      Prints out all the text following `SH' up to the end of the line
      (or the text in the next line if there is no argument to `SH') in
      bold face, one size larger than the base document size.
      Additionally, the left margin for the following text is reset to
      its default value.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .SS [heading]</EM>
      Set up an unnumbered (sub)section heading.  Prints out all the text
      following `SS' up to the end of the line (or the text in the next
      line if there is no argument to `SS') in bold face, at the same
      size as the base document size.  Additionally, the left margin for
      the following text is reset to its default value.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .TP [nnn]</EM>
      Set up an indented paragraph with label.  The indentation is set to
      NNN if that argument is supplied (the default unit is `n' if
      omitted), otherwise it is set to the default indentation value.
 
      The first line of text following this macro is interpreted as a
      string to be printed flush-left, as it is appropriate for a label.
      It is not interpreted as part of a paragraph, so there is no
      attempt to fill the first line with text from the following input
      lines.  Nevertheless, if the label is not as wide as the
      indentation, then the paragraph starts at the same line (but
      indented), continuing on the following lines.  If the label is
      wider than the indentation, then the descriptive part of the
      paragraph begins on the line following the label, entirely
      indented.  Note that neither font shape nor font size of the label
      is set to a default value; on the other hand, the rest of the text
      has default font settings.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .LP</EM>
  <EM>- Macro: .PP</EM>
  <EM>- Macro: .P</EM>
      These macros are mutual aliases.  Any of them causes a line break
      at the current position, followed by a vertical space downwards by
      the amount specified by the `PD' macro.  The font size and shape
      are reset to the default value (10pt roman).  Finally, the current
      left margin is restored.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .IP [designator] [nnn]</EM>
      Set up an indented paragraph, using DESIGNATOR as a tag to mark
      its beginning.  The indentation is set to NNN if that argument is
      supplied (default unit is `n'), otherwise the default indentation
      value is used.  Font size and face of the paragraph (but not the
      designator) are reset to their default values.  To start an
      indented paragraph with a particular indentation but without a
      designator, use `""' (two double quotes) as the first argument of
      `IP'.
 
      For example, to start a paragraph with bullets as the designator
      and 4en indentation, write
 
 
           .IP \(bu 4
 
 
  <EM>- Macro: .HP [nnn]</EM>
      Set up a paragraph with hanging left indentation.  The indentation
      is set to NNN if that argument is supplied (default unit is `n'),
      otherwise the default indentation value is used.  Font size and
      face are reset to their default values.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .RS [nnn]</EM>
      Move the left margin to the right by the value NNN if specified
      (default unit is `n'); otherwise the default indentation value is
      used.  Calls to the `RS' macro can be nested.
 
  <EM>- Macro: .RE [nnn]</EM>
      Move the left margin back to level NNN; if no argument is given,
      it moves one level back.  The first level (i.e., no call to `RS'
      yet) has number 1, and each call to `RS' increases the level by 1.
 
    To summarize, the following macros cause a line break with the
 insertion of vertical space (which amount can be changed with the `PD'
 macro): `SH', `SS', `TP', `LP' (`PP', `P'), `IP', and `HP'.
 
    The macros `RS' and `RE' also cause a break but do not insert
 vertical space.

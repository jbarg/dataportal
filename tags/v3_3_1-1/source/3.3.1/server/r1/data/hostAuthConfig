# hostAuthConfig - The host based access configuration file.
#
# The first column specifies a user that is allowed to connection to
# this SRB. An entry of "all" means all users are allowed.
# The second and third columns specify the address and the address mask.
# Together, they define the client IP addresses/domains that are permitted
# to connect to the SRB server. The address column specifies the IP
# address and the Mask column specifies which bits that will be ignored. 
# i.e., after those bits are taken out, the connection address 
# must match the address in the address column.

This is a simple interface library for applications (such as MDSPlus)
to access SRB functionality at the object (file) level via calls
similar to unix IO calls(open, read, write, close, etc).  For more
information, see the top of the srbUio.h file and the srbUio.c file.

Currently this is known to work fine in Linux, but has not been tested
on others.  Some small changes will be needed to work on some OSes.

To build, first build the rest of the SRB tree, then cd to this
directory and run gmake.  See the Makefile for more information.

Initial version, October, 2003.

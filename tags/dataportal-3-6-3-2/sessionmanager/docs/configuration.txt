Pre-installation Tasks
----------------------

1. Install postgres (if necessary)

2. Create a new database called sessionmanager: default user and password is dpuser/dp4all.
If different username and password are used then edit the file sessionmanager/web/sm.conf as
follows:

# database user
db_user=<postgres user>

# database password
db_password=<postgres password>

3. Create the tables SESSION and SESSION_ACCESS_RIGHTS in the sessionmanager database
using the following scripts (in this directory) within psql (postgres utility):

\i session.sql
\i session_access_rights.sql

These tables hold current session information. When the Session Manager's startSession 
method is called, a new row is created in the SESSION table with a new unique session
identifier and the user name. In addition, a number of rows are created in the 
SESSION_ACCESS_RIGHTS, each row representing the permissions that the session has to a 
particular facility e.g

    for session id 9, user has access to facility BADC, it's metadata and data
    but for facility MPIM the user has access to metadata only

4. Create the sequence to generate unique session identifier using the following script:

\i session.seq

5. Ensure that the server where the Session Manager web service is installed has access
to the postgres database. If not edit the <POSTGRES_HOME>/data/pga_hb.conf file and add
the IP address to the list. You will need to restart postgres.


To test the module individually
-------------------------------

1. Install the web service (as above) 

2. Run TestClient.class with the following arguments:

<web service address> <method> <args>
e.g.    "http://localhost:8080/axis/services/SessionManager" isValid <session identifier>
        "http://localhost:8080/axis/services/SessionManager" getDName <session identifier>
        "http://localhost:8080/axis/services/SessionManager" getPermissions <session identifier>
        "http://localhost:8080/axis/services/SessionManager" endSession <session identifier>

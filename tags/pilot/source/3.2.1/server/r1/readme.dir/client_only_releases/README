This is a client-only release of the SRB code.

Although SRB is freely available to gov and edu sites, there are some
restrictions to commercial sites and so our full release requires a
decryption key (see our web site).  For this client-only release,
however, we are able to make available without encryption.

The purpose of this is to make it easier for people to build SRB
client programs and API libraries.  But to use these, you will need to
to set up the SRB environment files to connect to an SRB server system
of your choice.

For more information, see the readme.dir documents and/or the SRB
web site at http://www.npaci.edu/dice/srb/

To build:

1) Edit mk/mk.config changing the 
PORTNAME=PORTNAME_[something]      to 
PORTNAME=PORTNAME_[your OS]        (e.g. PORTNAME_linux for linux
or one of the other supported OS types).  See the comments in mk.config.
(Unlike our full release, this client-only release does not use configure.)

2) gmake

You should then have the Scommands under utilities/bin.

3) copy the utilities/bin to your install directory (or use them in
the current location).  'gmake install' is not supported in this
client-only release.

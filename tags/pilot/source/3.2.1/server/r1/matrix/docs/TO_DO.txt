Notes:
======
(0) Status Codes explaination:

[X] = Completed
[ ] = Open  (not investigated, not solved)
[!] = Open; URGENT, show stopper - please finish it
[-] = Partial done or temporary hack
[$] = New feature or near future stuff 


(1) Seems to me there is a bug in Status Query Response. The expected behavior is to have the 
Transaction Status have all the flows and steps if only the TransactionStatus is enquired. It seems
the system expects to provide values to match (or exceed) the number of real flows and steps.

(2) The Result must have separate stuff for Matrix Results and SRB Resutls (we have discussed this before).

(3) The problem was due to differnt default file storage or caching stuff by Jargon and tomcat. It is solved now using the cache folder this.

(4) Check if status response is sent with busy/started etc for the steps

(5) Seems they are used inside the core-engine by Reena.

(6) Server is returning step status as either no steps or all complete simultaneously.
    FIX: CurrentFlowID had to be set before logging flow start status

(7) SOAP implementation used does not buffer when making a .call - machine (and java's heap size) needs to have at least
    amount of memory greater than the request size. lpw22 always fails on SOAP messages larger than 20mb no matter the
    heap size. Heap size can be set with environment variable JAVA_OPTS='-Xms32m -Xmx128m' , etc.

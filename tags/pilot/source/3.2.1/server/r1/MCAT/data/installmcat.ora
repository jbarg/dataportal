We no longer recommend the use of these scripts (but are leaving them
here as examples).  Instead, we recommend you do this in two separate
steps and run the sqlplus commands by hand.  See README.MCAT.INSTALL.

#!/bin/csh
#source $HOME/.cshrc
#setenv ORACLE_HOME /dbms/oracle/v01/app/oracle/product/8.1.5
#setenv ORACLE_SID MCAT 
#rm data/myinstall.results.ora data/mytest.results.ora
#echo "RUN  UnInstall or Clean if required. No clean up is automatically done."
#echo "installation started"
#sqlplus USERID/PASSWD@MCAT  @data/catalog.install.ora >& data/myinstall.results.ora
#diff data/myinstall.results.ora data/install.results.ora
#wc data/*install.results.ora
#echo "installation completed. Successful if diff and wc results above are identical (modulo date/time)."
#echo "testing started - this may take a few minutes"
#cd bin
#test.catalog >& ../data/mytest.results.ora
#cd ..
#diff data/mytest.results.ora data/test.results.ora
#wc data/*test.results.ora
#echo "testing completed. Successful if diff and wc results above are identical."
#echo "installation and testing completed."

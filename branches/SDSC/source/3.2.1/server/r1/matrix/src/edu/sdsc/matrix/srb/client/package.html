Provides classes for easy use of Matrix Web Services without needing to go to
the low level of JAXB and SOAP. These client docs are still under construction,
and will be updated significantly in the next release. As such, there are a few
holes right now in the documentation. Of course, any questions can be directed
to https://lists.sdsc.edu/mailman/listinfo.cgi/srb-chat.


<h2>Matrix Client API</h2>

The Matrix Client API addresses the inherent tedium in using JAXB auto-generated
classes when using the DataGridLanguage. Using JAXB classes involve the process
of getXXX and setXXX methods that lead to a large amount of code and keeps the
user tied up.<br/><br/>
Gotcha: DGResponse, might want to get ssResponse, so use clientGetSSResponse if
direct. 

If want to use a client method like getResultString of metadataresult, must
first cast to metadataresult.<br/><br/>
<pre>
(wont work) return X.getMetaDataResult.getResultString()<br/>

(instead) return ((MetaDataResult)X.getMetaDataResult).getResultString
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
                    Cast to a Client API MetaDataResult vs parser.MetadataResult
</pre>
<br/><br/>

Component objects of DGresponses (which are of type Interface
edu.sdsc.matrix.srb.parser.Class) returned by MatrixCOnnection are meant to be
guaranteed to be castable to Client API classes of the same name. However, as of
this release, there is still some wrapping to do left, and not all of the
components of a DataGridResponse can be guaranteed to be an instance of a Client
class of the same name. In other words, most are, but some aren't. In the next
release, they should all be guaranteed to be castable to the client
classes.<br/><br/>

This casting to use client classes is there because of the inherent "weakness" of using 
auto generated interface instead of custom written classes, which sacrifices
specific usage patterns for generic usability.<br/><br/>

Stuff like AnyType or AnyDirectory: If you dont know what it is you probably don't need
it.<br/><br/>

Usage pattern for DataGridResponse components - user communication with a Matrix
server wont actually create any objects. Instead the returned DataGridResponse
holds all its contents as these class objects and the user uses the getXXX
methods to retrieve them and cast them to client API classes.<br/><br/>

When a call to MatrixConnection.send is made and a DataGridResponse is received
from the Matrix Server, the DataGridResponse is wrapped internally into
instances of the client API classes. However, since the interface still
specifies objects of the parser.&lt;Class&gt; type, the user must cast them into
client objects if the user wants to use them as such.<br/><br/>
TransactionStatusResponse tsr =
   (TransactionStatusResponse)DataGridResponse.getTransactionStatusResponse();

                              Grid FTP Client Portlet 

			      Version VERSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Grid FTP Client portlet has the basic functions of Grid FTP client, 
such as uploading, downloading, third party transferring, and a tree-like 
directory browsing interface.

PREREQUISITES:
--------------

1. GNU tar (or ensure that your tar can handle paths longer than 100
   characters long)

2. Jakarta Ant (we use version 1.5 but it will probably work with most earlier
   versions too) - http://jakarta.apache.org/ant

INSTALL:
--------

To install the Grid FTP Client portlet into your Jetspeed portal, you'll need
to: 

1.  Untar and unzip xportlets-gridftpclient-VERSION-[src,bin].tar.gz.

2.  Define alliance.home in file build.properties. "alliance.home" is your
    alliance portal installation.

2.  For binary distribution, execute:

      ant deploy

    For source distribution, execute:

      ant build deploy

3.  You have to insert the following text into ${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/jetspeed/web.xml
    You may also find them in servlet-entries.xml and servlet-mapping.xml.

    <web-app> 
      ...
        <servlet>
            <servlet-name>
                    GridFTPDownload
            </servlet-name>
            <servlet-class>
                    xportlets/gridftp/GridFTPDownload
            </servlet-class>
        </servlet>
      ...
        <servlet-mapping>
            <servlet-name>
               GridFTPDownload

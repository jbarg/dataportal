                              ProxyManager
 
                              Version VERSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The ProxyManager portlet provides a interface for loading GSI proxy credentials
into Jetpeed via MyProxy.  The proxies are stored into a hash table in the
permanent storage area of the User structure under the key "proxies".  This
means that proxies can survive a portlet reload but will be destroyed if the
user logs out or the portal is restarted.
 
For further information, please refer to the html documentation in the 'docs'
directory.

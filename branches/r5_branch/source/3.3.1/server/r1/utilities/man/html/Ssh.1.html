Ssh - Invokes the SRB shell.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>The Ssh command executes commands (both normal UNIX commands and</B>

S-commands) read from a terminal or a file. 
<P>
The primary goal for the design of Ssh is to reduce the 
client/server connection overhead of S-command (the family of 
SRB command such as Sinit, Sls, Sput, Sget, etc). Currently, after initializing 
with the Sinit command, each S-command can be run as an independent 
UNIX command. Within each S-command, a new connection to the SRB server 
is created at the start of the command and the connection is disconnected 
at the end of each command. The standalone Scommand model is simple and
easy to use.
However, the overhead of creating a SRB 
client/server connection is relatively high, especially on the server side. 
The high connection overhead causes lag time in command response especially
when the network latency between client and server is high, and consumes 
resources of the servers.    
<P>
The Ssh provides a shell for executing the S-commands such that all commands use
the same SRB connection to communicate with the SRB server. Other
UNIX commands (binary and shell script) can also be run within the
shell.  
<P>
Like other shell commands, Ssh can be in interactive mode which reads
and executes commands from a terminal or can be used to issue a
single command or shell script using the &quot;-c command&quot; option. 
<P>
Unlike other shell commands, Ssh does not have its own scripting language
but shell script files written for other shells can be executed by Ssh.
<BR>&nbsp;
Before running the Ssh command, the client's SRB environment (.MdasEnv
and .MdasAuth files) must be setup first (see the Sinit manpage for
SRB environment setup). 
The Sinit command does NOT need to be run before running Ssh since Ssh
carries out is own initialization. 
The Ssh can be started by typing in &quot;Ssh&quot; which puts the shell in
interactive mode. The shell begins reading and executing commands from the 
terminal after the prompt &quot;Ssh &gt;&quot;. A &quot;exit&quot; or &quot;quit&quot; command will
end the Ssh shell.
<P>
Internally, the Ssh uses other shell programs to interpret and execute  
the input commands (read from the terminal). The default shell is &quot;sh&quot;.
Other shells that work with Ssh include &quot;bash&quot; and &quot;ksh&quot;. &quot;csh&quot; and
&quot;tcsh&quot; do NOT work with Ssh because they seem to close all opened
file descriptors before executing the input commands. Hence the socket
connection to the SRB server will not be passed on to the input commands.
The environment variable SRB_SHELL can be used to set the shell used 
by Ssh. If it is set to NO_SRB_SHELL, the Ssh will use the fork() and
exec() calls to execute the input commands.
<P>
Another way to to start up an Scommand interactive session is
to use the Ssh command to run an interactive shell, e.g.,
<P>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>Ssh -c bash<BR>
<P>
An interactive bash shell session will be started with this command and
the SRB socket connection created by Ssh will be passed onto the bash shell. 
All Scommands executed in this bash shell will use this socket connection
to communicate with the SRB server. The advantage of this approach is
the full capability of the interactive shell will be maintained. 
The socket connection to the SRB server is maintained until the shell
is terminated. The Sexit command will not terminate the connection. 
Also, in this mode, if a CTRL-C key stroke is used to terminate a
Scommand, the socket connection to the SRB server will be left in an
unknown state and the interactive shell should be terminated and 
restarted. A better process termination handling in Ssh will be incorporated 
in future releases.
<P>
The Ssh can be used to issue a single command or shell script using the 
&quot;-c command&quot; option. e.g.,
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ssh&nbsp;-c&nbsp;myShellScript
<P>
where myShellScript can be a shell script written in &quot;sh&quot;, &quot;bash&quot;, &quot;ksh&quot; or
&quot;perl&quot;. The advantage of using Ssh is that a socket connection to the
SRB server is only created once and all Scommands in the script use this
connection to communicate the the SRB server which greatly reduces the connection
overhead. Since all Scommands in the script use the same socket connection,
it is NOT advisable to run these Scommands in the background because they
will be competing for the same socket connection.

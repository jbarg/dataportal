<LI><A NAME=LI1><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>What is MySRB?:</FONT></A>
MySRB is a web-based resource sharing system that allows users to share their 
scientific data collections with their colleagues. It provides a system where
users can organize their files according to logical cataloguing schemes 
independent of the physical location of the files and associate metadata with
these files. MySRB uses the Storage Resource 
Broker (SRB) and the Metadata Catalog (MCAT) developed at SDSC as its underlying infrastructure.

<LI><A NAME=LI2><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Who can use MySRB?:</FONT></A>
To use MySRB, one needs to become a registered user. 
Currently, MySRB is restricted to users from SDSC, that is users who have 
computer accounts at SDSC. Only these users can register as a MySRB user.

<LI><A NAME=LI3><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Can I use MySRB from anywhere?:</FONT></A>
Yes, except during registration. Once you become a registered user of MySRB, 
you can access it from anywhere using web Browsers. When registering, you 
need to use a browser from inside the firewall at SDSC (132.249.x.x).

<LI><A NAME=LI4><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>What about security?:</FONT></A>
MySRB uses secure-http (https) protocol using 128-bit RSA authentication.
Each session to MySRB is given a unique session key (and stored as in-memory 
cookie at the Browser). These session keys have a time-limit set on them
(currently 60 minutes) and are unusable after that time. MySRB also performs
certain checks on the session keys when validating a user request.

<LI><A NAME=LI4><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>What are the functionalities of MySRB?:</FONT></A>
MySRB provides three primary functionalities: 
<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>collection and file management</FONT>: operations for data ingestion & registration, data replication & movement, access control,versioning & locking, and data deletion & reload. </LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>metadata handling</FONT>: operations for ingestion, extraction,  maintenance, update, and deletion of userdefined and standard metadata</LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>access and display of files and metadata</FONT>: browsing for files in the collection hierarchy and to search/query using system-level, user-defined and standard metadata.</LI>
</UL>
<LI><A NAME=LI4><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>What is the meaning of the split-window?:</FONT></A>
The browser window of MySRB is split into two with a smaller <FONT COLOR=#FF0000>top-window</FONT> and a larger <FONT COLOR=#FF0000>bottom-window</FONT>. The top-window is used for displaying metadata about data objects and collections, and the bottom-window is used for displaying elements in a collections or for displaying data objects accessed by the user. When performing some operation, the window is used fully for gathering data from the user.

<LI><A NAME=LI4><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Please explain the buttons at the top of the 'bottom-window'?:</FONT></A> The buttons at the top of the bottom-window belong operationally to two sets. The first type operations are  'collection-based'
and the second type are generic. <P>
The collection-based operations are:
<TABLE>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFF99"><IMG SRC="https://srb.npaci.edu/uparrow.gif" ALT="Move Up"><BR>Move<BR>Up</A></TD><TD>This button helps to change to the parent of the current collection being displayed in the bottom-window.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFF99"><IMG SRC="https://srb.npaci.edu/ingestFile.gif" ALT="Ingest New File"><BR>Ingest<BR>File</A></TD><TD>This button brings up the screen to ingest a new file into the current collection from the local desktop. The ingested object is physically copied into SRB and stored in a resource or container chosen by the user. The user can also  associate  metadata for the  file during the ingestion process.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFF99"><IMG SRC="https://srb.npaci.edu/ingestFile.gif" ALT="Register New File"><BR>Register<BR>File</A></TD><TD>This button brings up the screen to register a new file into the current collection. The file may reside in any of the resources brokered by the SRB but is currently limited to unix file systems. No copying of the file is performed but the SRB should be have 'write' permission to the file in the remote resource. The user can also  associate  metadata for the  file during the registration process.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFF99"><IMG SRC="https://srb.npaci.edu/newsubcollection.gif" ALT="Register Directory"><BR>Register<BR>Directory</A></TD><TD>This buton brings up the screen to register an existing directory in a file system resource. The directory may reside in any of the resources brokered by the SRB but is currently limited to unix file systems. The directory or its contents are not copied into the SRB but only a link is registered. The SRB should be have 'write' permission to the file in the remote resource. The user can also  associate and query metadata for the  directories, subdirectories and underlying files as  for any SRB object.  The registered directory appears in a list of shadow objects in MySRB.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFF99"><IMG SRC="https://srb.npaci.edu/ingestFile.gif" ALT="Register URL"><BR>Register<BR>URL</A></TD><TD>This button brings up the screen to register a URL into the current collection.  No copying of the URL pointed file is performed but the contents of the URL is accessed and displayed at access time. The user can also  associate  and query metadata for the  URL object  as  for any SRB object.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFF99"><IMG SRC="https://srb.npaci.edu/ingestFile.gif" ALT="Register SQL"><BR>Register<BR>SQL</A></TD><TD>This buton brings up the screen to register a SQL query to a SRB-registered database. The user can also  associate and query metadata for the  SQL object as  for any SRB object. When registering the SQL the wrapper-style for the display of the SQL result needs to be associated. Users can associate any of the generic templates (such as HTML or XML) or any user-defined wrapper-style template stored in the SRB.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFF99"><IMG SRC="https://srb.npaci.edu/newsubcollection.gif" ALT="Create New SubCollection"><BR>Make<BR>Collection</A></TD><TD>This buton brings up the screen to create a new sub-collection under the current collection. Users can associate metadata for the new sub collections as well as metadata template to be used for newly ingested files. Also, one can associate a container to the new collection which will force the storage of files into that container upon ingestion. </TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFF99"><IMG SRC="https://srb.npaci.edu/showmeta.gif" ALT="Show Metadata"><BR>Show<BR>Meta</A></TD><TD>Redisplays the listing of files and sub-collections with user-defined metadata and annotations</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFF99"><IMG SRC="https://srb.npaci.edu/querymd.gif" ALT="Browse Query"><BR>Browse<BR>Query</A></TD><TD>This button brings up the screen for searching the collection based on user-defined metadata. </TD></TR>
</TABLE>
The generic operations are:
<TABLE>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFF99"><IMG SRC="https://srb.npaci.edu/mkcontainer.gif" ALT="Create New Container"><BR>Make<BR>Container</A></TD><TD>This button brings up the screen for creating a new container in the SRB.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFF99"><IMG SRC="https://srb.npaci.edu/querymd.gif" ALT="Query MetaData"><BR>Query<BR>Meta</A></TD><TD>This button brings up the screen for searching the collection based mainly on system-defined metadata. </TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFF99"><IMG SRC="https://srb.npaci.edu/otherinfo.gif" ALT="Other Info"><BR>Other<BR>Info</A></TD><TD>This button brings up a menu for accessing other meta information stored in the SRB including information about resources, users and containers.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFF99"><IMG SRC="https://srb.npaci.edu/help.gif" ALT="Help"><BR>Online<BR>Help</A></TD><TD>This button brings up this web page.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFF99"><IMG SRC="https://srb.npaci.edu/exitmysrb.gif" ALT="Exit MySRB"><BR>Exit<BR>MySRB</A></TD><TD>This button terminates the current MySRB session.</TD></TR>

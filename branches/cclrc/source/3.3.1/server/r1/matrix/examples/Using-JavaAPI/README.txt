SDSC Matrix Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This directory contains some examples.The examples illustrate the use of the Data Grid Language (DGL) in the Grid Workflow (GridFlow) Management.


The DGL document can be created using an XML editor like (XML Spy) or Programmatically using the JAVA API or using a Graphical User Interface focusing the end domain user.

The directory "Using-JavaAPI" contains java programs that illustrate how DGL can be programmatically developed and sent to the Matrix Server. The "HelloMatrix.java" is a simple program to start with. You may wish to look at the source code. It used the Matrix Client API. 
The Client API docs are available in the website. They can also be created by running the ant command "ant client-docs" in the Matrix home directory (contains build.xml file).


We highly encourage you to look into the DGL schema using an XML Editor before starting. You can send the DGL documents you make to the Matrix server using the java program DGLSender.java.  Running DGLSender with no command line arguments prints instructions on how to use the program.

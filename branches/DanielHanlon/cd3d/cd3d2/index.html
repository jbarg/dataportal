<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>CrystalDisplay3D is a small application
written in Java for the visualization and manipulation of data files related
to crystalline structure and electron charge density.</font></font>
<p><font size=+1>Amongst other things, Java is a platform independent language
so CrystalDisplay3D will run on any platform supporting the required Java
implementation.</font>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="how"></a>What do I need to run it?
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h2>

<blockquote><font size=+1>This application has been designed to be based
on a web-page and run from there on whichever machine the user happens
to have. The only caveat to this, is that the platform must support <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/">Java
2</a> and the standard 3D extension library known as <a href="http://sun.com/desktop/java3d/">Java3D</a>.</font>
<p><font size=+1><a href="http://sun.com/desktop/java3d/">Java3D</a> provides
a complete API for developing complex three dimensional scenes in the Java
language. Due to the nature of the calculations involved in 3D displays
it was decided that the Java3D should be implemented by providing an interface
to an underlying platform dependent 3D rendering engine.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Java3D effectively extends the procedures of the standard
virtual machine, when dealing with functionality that is intrinsically
hardware dependent, to the domain of 3D graphics. By doing so, the programmer
is able to work with a standard interface which additionally provides an
extra layer of abstraction from the rendering engine to allow scenes to
be programmed with a higher level description. The Java3D run-time environment
automatically makes use of the 3D processing capabilities present on the
client machine. A graphics card that is capable of intercepting <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a>
calls to provide hardware acceleration is automatically employed by Java3D
as on that machine the OpenGL version should be installed and the run-time
environment would itself be making the calls to OpenGL.</font>
<p><font size=+1>On the Windows/x86 platform, neither of the most popular
web-browsers ( Netscape &amp; Internet Explorer ) provide a complete implementation
of the Java 2 standard so it is necessary to use the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/">Java
Plug-In</a> which may be downloaded at no charge. The following steps are
recommended to provide support for CrystalDisplay3D.</font>

<b><i><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Windows/Solaris</font></font></i></b>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Download the Java plug-in version 1.2.2
from
<a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/j2sdk122/index.html">here.</a></font></font></li>

<ul><font color="#000000">This is the latest release version and it fixes
some bugs which greatly complicated the installation process. It is currently,
however, only available following free registration with the Java Developers
Connection (<a href="http://java.sun.com/jdc/">JDC</a>).</font></ul>

<li>
<font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Download the Java3D run-time environment
from <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/index.html">here.</a></font></font></li>

<ul><font color="#000000">For Windows versions are available which use
either OpenGL or DirectX as the native rendering engine. The OpenGL version
is a later release and should be used unless hardware acceleration for
DirectX is present on your machine.</font></ul>

<li>
<font size=+1>Install the Java plug-in.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>Install the Java 3D run-time environment into the directory
within the plug-in.</font></li>

<ul><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>e.g., if the plug-in has been installed
to</font></font>

C:\Program Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.2</font></font>
<br><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>this directory should also be used
as the installation path for Java3D.</font></font></ul>

<li>
<font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Point your browser at the <a href="file://c:/Inetpub/wwwroot/cd3d/examples.html">examples</a>
web-page.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000"><font size=+1>The plug-in will request privileges
to be granted to the applet - this is to allow it to utilise the native
code involved with the 3D rendering. Agreeing to this will allow the applet
to proceed.</font></font></li>

<blockquote><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>The status of ports to
other platforms is continuously changing but implementations of Java 2
(also know as 1.2) and the Java 3D runtime environment are being produced
for most environments. In particular first release versions of both pieces
of software for Linux are available from <a href="http://www.blackdown.org">http://www.blackdown.org</a>
and SGI has release versions of <a href="http://www.sgi.com/developers/devtools/languages/java.html">Java

version of the Java3D runtime environment.</font></font>
